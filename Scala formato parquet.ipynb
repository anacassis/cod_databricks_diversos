They then hit my card for 3000 - before leaving London we had agreed with our card company that no transaction would exceed 2800 as we had had stolen/lost cards in the past. We had forgotten this limit and the receptionist said the card was rejected. We could not work out why this had happened. So we paid for 1 night with the intention to sort the problem in the morning. However when we went up to the room we were delighted with the bathroom and felt that the size of the room was just about adequate. I was still upset about the card being rejected so I called the 'local' number of my bank. They confirmed there were no problems but reminded me of the limit I had set. As the room did not have a fridge or safe and as we were so tired I decided to deal with the problems in the morning. The following day I went to reception and the manager (i presume) allowed me to pay the bill account on 2 cards saying he understood why this had happened. I asked anbot a fridge he said it would be delivered. There was no safe available. I was not asked to pay the 'extra' this time so payment was made of a further 2200 split on the 2 cards. We went out and on our return found a fridge of 3ft square in the bedroom - so large that it hampered access to the bathroom. We had eaten out so thought we would watch a movie. The TV in our room refused to show us what was available so I rang reception - only no the line was still connected to my European Bamk on the local number.

I'm sorry to hear your bank gave you so much trouble with your credit card but happy to hear the desk manager was able to work around it.

He later called and stated that he couldnt find one. (really) I could use the bathroom six rooms down for the night. I advised that this was unacceptable</td><td> as it would be disruptive as the kids would probable get up a couple of times. He stated that no one else was there and the manager didnt answer the phone and he couldnt find the plunger. I went out and purchased a plunger. When I returned it took me all of 30 seconds to have the toilet operating properly.At around 9:00 the next morning I went in and asked to see the manager. She refused to meet with me and advised the employee that she was on a conference call and wouldnt be available to meet until 2:00. I found this to be ludicrous and told the clerk so. I felt like making a scene but didnt as my children were there. When we returned from our day at Seaworld around 5:00 I met with the manager. She told me that it was good customer service to only offer a room change. I advised her of how much work it would that would have caused</td><td> and how disruptive it would have been to the young children and that it only took me a few seconds to fix the problem after I went out and bought the plunger.

There were a few hiccups</td><td> but I would probably stay again. (only if they fix the problems below)When I arrived Saturday afternoon</td><td> after my 4 hour drive</td><td> I really wanted to sit in the hot tub. I was told that it was not open due to some maintenance that needed to be done on both the pool and hot tub. I then tried to go into the hot tub the next morning and again was told it was not open and that it might be open later in the afternoon. I came back Sunday evening and it was raining</td><td> but the hot tub was finally open. So I sat in there while the rain came down and hit my face (not good and not long). Next I noticed the hotel had very nice flat screen T.V.'s in all the rooms that my family occupied. There was also HBO booklets next to the T.V.'s....only one problem. They did not have HBO or premium channels until the following weekend.. So I had to sit in a room with basic cable and no HBO or even the FX or History Channel. The breakfast was ok</td><td> but after the 2nd day I ate off site. The eggs were really watery and the sausage was as dry as beef jerky. The Orange Juice machine seemed to get worse each day</td><td> and on my third day it was like orange water.

I'll start with the good. Good:Check-in we were greeted by Sean. He has his customer service skills down! He was always friendly and willing to help. He told us how to work the shower. This saves people time so they don't have to call asking how it works. Easy to work</td><td> but I would not have known how to use it right away. So pay attention! He was able to put us in a room before check-in time (Which is at 3pm) we arrived around 11am. So everything was fine in our room. Something to note: when people close their doors its loud. There was noise in the night when sirens went by. But it was okay because our room was towards the back. Its location helps in that there isn't that much traffic so its less noisy than a hotel closer to Market St. (Our first trip to SF we were right off Market and we had to use earplugs) Free WiFi. One of the big reasons we chose this hotel was because it came with a mini fridge. We were able to store our food and water in there. Bad:On our last night I had just finished flossing and was throwing it away. I was leaning to spit into the sink as I am doing this a big cockroach is climbing out. This freaked me out and I screamed there's a cockroach. My sister who I am sharing a room with tells me to call the front desk. I do and ask if they have RAID or a bug spray he says no that he would send someone up. A man comes up I tell him where I saw it. He checks the whole bathroom and doesn't find it. I ask again if they have a spray he says no and says something about how they don't have those here (Meaning they don't have cockroaches). Then as he didn't find it he says what threw me over the edge You know your eyes can play tricks you. When he said that to me I just stared at him boiling inside and didn't say anything. After he said that I told my sister I was not going to speak to him anymore. To make a customer question what they saw and make them feel like they are crazy is just wrong. This upset me more than the cockroach. He told us to calm down and he said again that your eyes play tricks on you. My sister responded by saying she believes me and he proceeds to say if we want to change rooms in a tone you could hear he was getting mad/irritated by the situation. My sister informs him that it is our last night plus we were already in our pajamas ready to sleep (this all took place 11pm-12pm) really late. So my sister decides we sleep with the lights on. I don't know when my sister decided to dim them. But like an hour later my sister wakes up and she spots it near our bed. She tells me to call again. This time I reached for my glasses and my phone first. Ready to take a picture because the man did not believe me the first time. The cockroach went back to the bathroom and my sister followed it and watched where it would go. I called they sent the same man and he came in and my sister told him where it was. He then said he got it and said sorry and that his supervisors would not be happy. I didn't say anything to him. This took place at like 1-2 in the morning. We didn't sleep well which sucked because we had to catch our flight that morning. I'm giving them an average rating because everything was fine until that last night...Dear espy610</td><td>Thank you for your detailed review of the amenities and the friendly staff that assisted you throughout your stay.

Expecting a decent night sleep we were told they did not have a double room with a disabled friendly shower but a single room on the 7th Floor(they had elevators) with the correct shower.

They then hit my card for 3000 - before leaving London we had agreed with our card company that no transaction would exceed 2800 as we had had stolen/lost cards in the past. We had forgotten this limit and the receptionist said the card was rejected. We could not work out why this had happened. So we paid for 1 night with the intention to sort the problem in the morning. However when we went up to the room we were delighted with the bathroom and felt that the size of the room was just about adequate. I was still upset about the card being rejected so I called the 'local' number of my bank. They confirmed there were no problems but reminded me of the limit I had set. As the room did not have a fridge or safe and as we were so tired I decided to deal with the problems in the morning. The following day I went to reception and the manager (i presume) allowed me to pay the bill account on 2 cards saying he understood why this had happened. I asked anbot a fridge he said it would be delivered. There was no safe available. I was not asked to pay the 'extra' this time so payment was made of a further 2200 split on the 2 cards. We went out and on our return found a fridge of 3ft square in the bedroom - so large that it hampered access to the bathroom. We had eaten out so thought we would watch a movie. The TV in our room refused to show us what was available so I rang reception - only no the line was still connected to my European Bamk on the local number. This phone call connection lasted 3 days.and paid 17.98 3minute . So",
         " in spite of my disability I went down to reception and was told that they did not offer movies! As i had paid I could not afford to move and so we were stuck in this hotel.

I'm sorry to hear your bank gave you so much trouble with your credit card but happy to hear the desk manager was able to work around it. The reason you didn't have movies is because the 50.00 per night hold for incidentals (like movies",

         " good trip. Clean and friendly! It was mid summer when we stayed and we prefer ice cold room. Couldn't get it cool enough. Bed was comfy. Pillows a bit too thick for us. Cold water at faucet was warm to hot. Shower temp was perfectly hot. Would recommend more mirrors in room. A safe would be good addition and fridge. Enjoyed continental breakfast. Would stay at this beautiful hotel again. Thank you for the great review and your recent visit to the Whitney Hotel in New Orleans. We certainly appreciate you kind words and will pass them on the staff. It's our pleasure to provide excellent customer service to our guests. We look forward to hosting you again in the very near future. Sincerely",

The reception desk was once the teller desk and the old vault is located in the lobby. Our suite was very large with two rooms. The master bedroom was quite spacious and was separated from the sitting area by French doors. The sitting area had a sofa bed it's own television. The bathroom was also very spacious. The hotel offers free internet as well as complimentary coffee. There is a restaurant located in the lobby. The staff was very helpful and courteous.

The hot tub was also a welcome relief to sore muscles from all the walking we did on Old Town. One of the great features of this hotel is that it is walking distance to Old Town and restaurants. It is also centrally located to the freeway and MCRD and not far from the airport. It does have a shuttle on Thursday and Friday to MCRD. and LIMITED airport shuttle service.

We arrived back at the hotel for the 4 pm check in to be told it would be another 30 minutes before they had a room for us. When you state that's it's a 4 pm check in you have the rooms ready for 4 pm not 4.15 or 4.30. This shows me how much they regard their customers/guests.The room was clean and tidy but we had booked a deluxe room and we were not happy to see an adjoining door to the next room as we have experienced these before when we hear everything from the next room and I expect they hear everything from our room. If they want to cut energy costs then move the table away from the front of the a/c unit and let it work properly and don't mess about turning fridges off as they will run for longer to get cold again. Found the noise to be rather overbearing at times with guests stomping along the walkways and slamming doors at all hours if the night. Housekeeping seems to be scarce on the ground at this hotel at times. If we are in San Diego again I doubt we will pick this hotel again. It seems that Best Western has a special training course for front desk staff in how to be rude and unhelpful and to treat the guest as an problem rather than the reason for them having a job as this is the second Best Western we have encountered this poor service from front desk staff. All in I would not and could not recommend this hotel to anyone.",

         " one pool",
         " two hot tubs and a small restaurant on site. Some of the rooms come with microwaves",
         " fridges and other necessities. Sadly when I arrived at 3 they didn't have any rooms available for check in. We had to wait for half in hour but I didnt mind because we went out to eat and came back. We walk into our room which was right next to the pool and once we walk in the room had an old big fashion TV with a small fridge and no microwave. I asked about the microwave but all of those rooms were booked even though I booked my room 3 days in advance. The small thing I didn't mind but I did mind when the bath room door would not shut closed and the bed was rock hard. Also the internet they provide is WIRELESS B which is one of the slowest connections possible. I couldn't stream any thing on my laptop and at midnight my wife woke me up because she was hearing a LADY SCREAMING TO DEATH!! I call room service and they said they will send some one to check it out but another twenty minutes passed and the screams came again. Then after another phone call to the front desk we finally got some one to check it out and it was the couple next door fighting and throwing stuff at each other. The worst part was the front desk calls me two hours later to tell me they checked out the problem. This was at TWO in the MORNING!!! I would not recommend this hotel to any one. If you can spear the TEN BUCKS do it. I learned the hard way and went cheap and suffered the worst sleep that day. The only good thing was my daughter loved the warm pool that doesnt close until 10pm.Dear Guest"

She refused to meet with me and advised the employee that she was on a conference call and wouldnt be available to meet until 2:00. I found this to be ludicrous and told the clerk so. I felt like making a scene but didnt as my children were there. When we returned from our day at Seaworld around 5:00 I met with the manager.

         " and numerous restaraunts nearby. We had issues checking in and the room type we booked was not available the first night. We were put in a smaller room but we did get a discounted rate for the inconvenience. Breakfast included hot items but they left a bit to be desired but my kids loved the make your own waffles (get there early or prepare to stand in line for quite a while). The outdoor heated pool/hot tub area was nice and well stocked with towels. The rooms were a bit tight (family suites) but they were very clean and the beds were comfortable. There are lots of families that stay here so there was constant noise from children running the corridors so if you are looking for peace and quiet this might not be for you. Overall a nice stay despite a few issues.We are glad that you liked the location of the hotel which is very close to all the attractions",

Every street corner was filled with people begging so be prepared to have your dollar bills ready. Breakfast downstairs in the restaurant was good. Great shopping near by. Enjoy!\"\"",

They just had a boxed breakfast sitting in the back room where It should be in the fridge. It's better to go 2 doors down to the breakfast place. It's inexpensive and the food was good.

         " but I can't our last night was the worst! I'll start with the good. Good:Check-in we were greeted by Sean. He has his customer service skills down! He was always friendly and willing to help. He told us how to work the shower. This saves people time so they don't have to call asking how it works. Easy to work",
         " but I would not have known how to use it right away. So pay attention! He was able to put us in a room before check-in time (Which is at 3pm) we arrived around 11am. So everything was fine in our room. Something to note: when people close their doors its loud. There was noise in the night when sirens went by. But it was okay because our room was towards the back. Its location helps in that there isn't that much traffic so its less noisy than a hotel closer to Market St. (Our first trip to SF we were right off Market and we had to use earplugs) Free WiFi. One of the big reasons we chose this hotel was because it came with a mini fridge. We were able to store our food and water in there. Bad:On our last night I had just finished flossing and was throwing it away. I was leaning to spit into the sink as I am doing this a big cockroach is climbing out. This freaked me out and I screamed there's a cockroach. My sister who I am sharing a room with tells me to call the front desk. I do and ask if they have RAID or a bug spray he says no that he would send someone up. A man comes up I tell him where I saw it. He checks the whole bathroom and doesn't find it. I ask again if they have a spray he says no and says something about how they don't have those here (Meaning they don't have cockroaches). Then as he didn't find it he says what threw me over the edge You know your eyes can play tricks you. When he said that to me I just stared at him boiling inside and didn't say anything. After he said that I told my sister I was not going to speak to him anymore. To make a customer question what they saw and make them feel like they are crazy is just wrong. This upset me more than the cockroach. He told us to calm down and he said again that your eyes play tricks on you. My sister responded by saying she believes me and he proceeds to say if we want to change rooms in a tone you could hear he was getting mad/irritated by the situation. My sister informs him that it is our last night plus we were already in our pajamas ready to sleep (this all took place 11pm-12pm) really late. So my sister decides we sleep with the lights on. I don't know when my sister decided to dim them. But like an hour later my sister wakes up and she spots it near our bed. She tells me to call again. This time I reached for my glasses and my phone first. Ready to take a picture because the man did not believe me the first time. The cockroach went back to the bathroom and my sister followed it and watched where it would go. I called they sent the same man and he came in and my sister told him where it was. He then said he got it and said sorry and that his supervisors would not be happy. I didn't say anything to him. This took place at like 1-2 in the morning. We didn't sleep well which sucked because we had to catch our flight that morning. I'm giving them an average rating because everything was fine until that last night...Dear espy610",

They then hit my card for 3000 - before leaving London we had agreed with our card company that no transaction would exceed 2800 as we had had stolen/lost cards in the past.

However when we went up to the room we were delighted with the bathroom and felt that the size of the room was just about adequate. I was still upset about the card being rejected so I called the 'local' number of my bank. They confirmed there were no problems but reminded me of the limit I had set. As the room did not have a fridge or safe and as we were so tired I decided to deal with the problems in the morning. The following day I went to reception and the manager (i presume) allowed me to pay the bill account on 2 cards saying he understood why this had happened. I asked anbot a fridge he said it would be delivered. There was no safe available. I was not asked to pay the 'extra' this time so payment was made of a further 2200 split on the 2 cards.

Do Not stay in room 1501. Although the room seems like it is a bit away from the elevators the bed room is right next to the elevator shaft.

All night all day whenever someone was in the elevator. I complained the first night to the front desk and actually a maintenance guy</td><td> Jared. He said that Otis elevator was actually on site fixing the elevators. They actually came to room but could not figure out where the noise was coming from. I did mention it again on Wednesday but they did not do anything. They could have at least moved me to another room. On Friday I was supposed to meet someone for dinner. I did not have his cell though. I had stepped out of the room for a bit</td><td> unfortunately right when he called at 630. He tried again at 7. The staff did not leave a message on my room phone (or my cell/email which they had). At 9 I received a call from the front desk that I received 2 calls at 630 and 7. When I asked why I am just hearing about it at 9</td><td> the woman said the note got lost and they had just found it. Oh did I say the pool was closed. Lastly</td><td> 1501 is a joined room and on Friday night</td><td> at 11 a family decided to have a fight where someone was slapped and the mother and little daughter started crying.

If they want to cut energy costs then move the table away from the front of the a/c unit and let it work properly and don't mess about turning fridges off as they will run for longer to get cold again.

Housekeeping seems to be scarce on the ground at this hotel at times. If we are in San Diego again I doubt we will pick this hotel again.

My children were just going to bed so moving and doing the work would have been quite intrusive.

He later called and stated that he couldnt find one. (really) I could use the bathroom six rooms down for the night. I advised that this was unacceptable</td><td> as it would be disruptive as the kids would probable get up a couple of times. He stated that no one else was there and the manager didnt answer the phone and he couldnt find the plunger. I went out and purchased a plunger. When I returned it took me all of 30 seconds to have the toilet operating properly.At around 9:00 the next morning I went in and asked to see the manager. She refused to meet with me and advised the employee that she was on a conference call and wouldnt be available to meet until 2:00. I found this to be ludicrous and told the clerk so. I felt like making a scene but didnt as my children were there. When we returned from our day at Seaworld around 5:00 I met with the manager. She told me that it was good customer service to only offer a room change. I advised her of how much work it would that would have caused</td><td> and how disruptive it would have been to the young children and that it only took me a few seconds to fix the problem after I went out and bought the plunger. I told her she should be embarrassed about the customer service</td><td> she advised that she was proud of it and all of her employees. I asked for information on the ownership of the hotel</td><td> or her manager. She only would give me the choice 1-800 number. She actually stated that she didnt have that information.

I'll start with the good. Good:Check-in we were greeted by Sean. He has his customer service skills down! He was always friendly and willing to help. He told us how to work the shower. This saves people time so they don't have to call asking how it works. Easy to work</td><td> but I would not have known how to use it right away. So pay attention! He was able to put us in a room before check-in time (Which is at 3pm) we arrived around 11am. So everything was fine in our room. Something to note: when people close their doors its loud. There was noise in the night when sirens went by. But it was okay because our room was towards the back. Its location helps in that there isn't that much traffic so its less noisy than a hotel closer to Market St. (Our first trip to SF we were right off Market and we had to use earplugs) Free WiFi. One of the big reasons we chose this hotel was because it came with a mini fridge. We were able to store our food and water in there. Bad:On our last night I had just finished flossing and was throwing it away. I was leaning to spit into the sink as I am doing this a big cockroach is climbing out. This freaked me out and I screamed there's a cockroach. My sister who I am sharing a room with tells me to call the front desk. I do and ask if they have RAID or a bug spray he says no that he would send someone up. A man comes up I tell him where I saw it. He checks the whole bathroom and doesn't find it. I ask again if they have a spray he says no and says something about how they don't have those here (Meaning they don't have cockroaches). Then as he didn't find it he says what threw me over the edge You know your eyes can play tricks you. When he said that to me I just stared at him boiling inside and didn't say anything. After he said that I told my sister I was not going to speak to him anymore. To make a customer question what they saw and make them feel like they are crazy is just wrong. This upset me more than the cockroach. He told us to calm down and he said again that your eyes play tricks on you. My sister responded by saying she believes me and he proceeds to say if we want to change rooms in a tone you could hear he was getting mad/irritated by the situation. My sister informs him that it is our last night plus we were already in our pajamas ready to sleep (this all took place 11pm-12pm) really late. So my sister decides we sleep with the lights on. I don't know when my sister decided to dim them. But like an hour later my sister wakes up and she spots it near our bed. She tells me to call again. This time I reached for my glasses and my phone first. Ready to take a picture because the man did not believe me the first time. The cockroach went back to the bathroom and my sister followed it and watched where it would go. I called they sent the same man and he came in and my sister told him where it was. He then said he got it and said sorry and that his supervisors would not be happy. I didn't say anything to him. This took place at like 1-2 in the morning. We didn't sleep well which sucked because we had to catch our flight that morning. I'm giving them an average rating because everything was fine until that last night...Dear espy610</td><td>Thank you for your detailed review of the amenities and the friendly staff that assisted you throughout your stay.

Expecting a decent night sleep we were told they did not have a double room with a disabled friendly shower but a single room on the 7th Floor(they had elevators) with the correct shower.

They then hit my card for 3000 - before leaving London we had agreed with our card company that no transaction would exceed 2800 as we had had stolen/lost cards in the past. We had forgotten this limit and the receptionist said the card was rejected. We could not work out why this had happened. So we paid for 1 night with the intention to sort the problem in the morning. However when we went up to the room we were delighted with the bathroom and felt that the size of the room was just about adequate. I was still upset about the card being rejected so I called the 'local' number of my bank. They confirmed there were no problems but reminded me of the limit I had set. As the room did not have a fridge or safe and as we were so tired I decided to deal with the problems in the morning. The following day I went to reception and the manager (i presume) allowed me to pay the bill account on 2 cards saying he understood why this had happened. I asked anbot a fridge he said it would be delivered. There was no safe available. I was not asked to pay the 'extra' this time so payment was made of a further 2200 split on the 2 cards. We went out and on our return found a fridge of 3ft square in the bedroom - so large that it hampered access to the bathroom. We had eaten out so thought we would watch a movie. The TV in our room refused to show us what was available so I rang reception - only no the line was still connected to my European Bamk on the local number. This phone call connection lasted 3 days.and paid 17.98 3minute . So",
         " in spite of my disability I went down to reception and was told that they did not offer movies! As i had paid I could not afford to move and so we were stuck in this hotel.

I'm sorry to hear your bank gave you so much trouble with your credit card but happy to hear the desk manager was able to work around it. The reason you didn't have movies is because the 50.00 per night hold for incidentals (like movies",

I did not have his cell though. I had stepped out of the room for a bit",

They offfered suggestions on where to eat and handed out some free appetizer coupons to local restaurants. This location has a Starbucks's that served breakfast. Breakfast was not free unless you have a voucher from the front desk. Christian was very nice and gave us vouchers for one morning of our stay. The pool is heated and felt great. The hot tub was also a welcome relief to sore muscles from all the walking we did on Old Town. One of the great features of this hotel is that it is walking distance to Old Town and restaurants. It is also centrally located to the freeway and MCRD and not far from the airport. It does have a shuttle on Thursday and Friday to MCRD. and LIMITED airport shuttle service. The only drawbacks were you had to pay for nightly parking and the computers were very slow and the printer was not working. The rooms were clean and updated.\"\"",

All I had to do was present Voucher upon check in Spoke to the Operations Director the next day. She couldn't do it either.

         "We arrived at this hotel a little early for check in so we went to get some essentials from the supermarket. We arrived back at the hotel for the 4 pm check in to be told it would be another 30 minutes before they had a room for us. When you state that's it's a 4 pm check in you have the rooms ready for 4 pm not 4.15 or 4.30. This shows me how much they regard their customers/guests.The room was clean and tidy but we had booked a deluxe room and we were not happy to see an adjoining door to the next room as we have experienced these before when we hear everything from the next room and I expect they hear everything from our room. If they want to cut energy costs then move the table away from the front of the a/c unit and let it work properly and don't mess about turning fridges off as they will run for longer to get cold again. Found the noise to be rather overbearing at times with guests stomping along the walkways and slamming doors at all hours if the night. Housekeeping seems to be scarce on the ground at this hotel at times. If we are in San Diego again I doubt we will pick this hotel again. It seems that Best Western has a special training course for front desk staff in how to be rude and unhelpful and to treat the guest as an problem rather than the reason for them having a job as this is the second Best Western we have encountered this poor service from front desk staff.

I asked about the microwave but all of those rooms were booked even though I booked my room 3 days in advance. The small thing I didn't mind but I did mind when the bath room door would not shut closed and the bed was rock hard. Also the internet they provide is WIRELESS B which is one of the slowest connections possible. I couldn't stream any thing on my laptop and at midnight my wife woke me up because she was hearing a LADY SCREAMING TO DEATH!! I call room service and they said they will send some one to check it out but another twenty minutes passed and the screams came again. Then after another phone call to the front desk we finally got some one to check it out and it was the couple next door fighting and throwing stuff at each other. The worst part was the front desk calls me two hours later to tell me they checked out the problem. This was at TWO in the MORNING!!! I would not recommend this hotel to any one. If you can spear the TEN BUCKS do it. I learned the hard way and went cheap and suffered the worst sleep that day. The only good thing was my daughter loved the warm pool that doesnt close until 10pm.Dear Guest"

The air conditioner was a bit noisy so if you are a light sleeper it will bother you if you run it at night. The window does open but it is on the walkway side of the room. There are two hot tubs on the property and a pool. I ate at the cafe on the property and it was very good. They DO NOT offer airport transportation but I got and Uber for about 4.",

I would definitely stay here again and highly recommend to families with kids and travelling on a budget!Thank you for the nice comments.

Liked their way of saving the environment. Requested for the towels to be changed.I wish the management had extra soaps since there were 5 people staying in the suite.

She refused to meet with me and advised the employee that she was on a conference call and wouldnt be available to meet until 2:00. I found this to be ludicrous and told the clerk so. I felt like making a scene but didnt as my children were there. When we returned from our day at Seaworld around 5:00 I met with the manager.

Next I noticed the hotel had very nice flat screen T.V.'s in all the rooms that my family occupied. There was also HBO booklets next to the T.V.'s....only one problem. They did not have HBO or premium channels until the following weekend.. So I had to sit in a room with basic cable and no HBO or even the FX or History Channel. The breakfast was ok",

Walked to chinatown and Union Square. The only complaint: We were offered a breakfast with our rate and the yogurt was warm. They just had a boxed breakfast sitting in the back room where It should be in the fridge. It's better to go 2 doors down to the breakfast place. It's inexpensive and the food was good. I would stay here again in a heartbeat. The men that worked the front desk were the best. They could answer anything and were very helpful. Can't wait to go back someday!",

         "\"\"I was looking forward to giving this hotel an amazing review",
         " but I can't our last night was the worst! I'll start with the good. Good:Check-in we were greeted by Sean. He has his customer service skills down! He was always friendly and willing to help. He told us how to work the shower. This saves people time so they don't have to call asking how it works. Easy to work",
         " but I would not have known how to use it right away. So pay attention! He was able to put us in a room before check-in time (Which is at 3pm) we arrived around 11am. So everything was fine in our room. Something to note: when people close their doors its loud. There was noise in the night when sirens went by. But it was okay because our room was towards the back. Its location helps in that there isn't that much traffic so its less noisy than a hotel closer to Market St. (Our first trip to SF we were right off Market and we had to use earplugs) Free WiFi. One of the big reasons we chose this hotel was because it came with a mini fridge. We were able to store our food and water in there. Bad:On our last night I had just finished flossing and was throwing it away. I was leaning to spit into the sink as I am doing this a big cockroach is climbing out. This freaked me out and I screamed there's a cockroach. My sister who I am sharing a room with tells me to call the front desk. I do and ask if they have RAID or a bug spray he says no that he would send someone up. A man comes up I tell him where I saw it. He checks the whole bathroom and doesn't find it. I ask again if they have a spray he says no and says something about how they don't have those here (Meaning they don't have cockroaches). Then as he didn't find it he says what threw me over the edge You know your eyes can play tricks you. When he said that to me I just stared at him boiling inside and didn't say anything. After he said that I told my sister I was not going to speak to him anymore. To make a customer question what they saw and make them feel like they are crazy is just wrong. This upset me more than the cockroach. He told us to calm down and he said again that your eyes play tricks on you. My sister responded by saying she believes me and he proceeds to say if we want to change rooms in a tone you could hear he was getting mad/irritated by the situation. My sister informs him that it is our last night plus we were already in our pajamas ready to sleep (this all took place 11pm-12pm) really late. So my sister decides we sleep with the lights on. I don't know when my sister decided to dim them. But like an hour later my sister wakes up and she spots it near our bed. She tells me to call again. This time I reached for my glasses and my phone first. Ready to take a picture because the man did not believe me the first time. The cockroach went back to the bathroom and my sister followed it and watched where it would go. I called they sent the same man and he came in and my sister told him where it was. He then said he got it and said sorry and that his supervisors would not be happy. I didn't say anything to him. This took place at like 1-2 in the morning. We didn't sleep well which sucked because we had to catch our flight that morning. I'm giving them an average rating because everything was fine until that last night...Dear espy610",
